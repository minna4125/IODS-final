#Research questions
#### Can we predict with chosen variables wether anime is being liked or not?
#### 

##Link to the R-script

       
## The data
#### The data is downloaded from kaggele (2.3.2017).
<https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database>
It orgins from myanimelist.net website.
Data is about animes ratings in myanimelist.net.

Variables in the data:
1. type is a factor variable which has values [Movie, TV, OVA, ONA, Special, TV]
2. episodes, which is the number of episodes anime has.
3. members is the number of people in the animes "fan group"
4. genre_clusters is the number of cluster that the animes genres belong to [1-8].
  - Why? There was over 2000 unique genre combinations of the 44 genres. Putting them into groups by clustering made it a resonable variable to look into.



Data modification
  1. Animes with NA values were removed (such as animes with no genre or type)
  2. 44 genres were reduced to 8 clusters 
  3. Anime names were made to a rownames
